 * Note: In TypeScript, most methods return Promises since the implementation
 * may rely on fetching data from IndexedDB which is async.
 * These Promises will only be rejected on an I/O error or other internal
 * (unexpected) failure (e.g. failed assert) and always represent an
 * unrecoverable error (should be caught / reported by the async_queue).
